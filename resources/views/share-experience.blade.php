             <h3>Traveling to Punta Cana: My Experience in the Dominican Republic</h3>
             <p>Sometimes, getting away from the hectic pace of life is just what you need to freshen up. The need for an escape is why I took a leap and booked a flight from California, U.S.A, to Punta Cana, D.R, for a breather. </p>
             <p>This trip for two was an exhilarating and needed experience for us, so I wanted to take a minute and share it with you. </p>
             <p>If you’ve been eyeing a <span>trip to Punta Cana</span> , I suggest you read on for all the details of our trip. Let’s get started!</p>
            <img src="{{ asset('images/punta_cana.jpg') }}" class="img-fluid" alt="" />
            <h3>Punta Cana: Pinpointing the Location</h3>
            <p>Before we get started, I think it’s best to do a quick overview of the location for those who need a little more information on Punta Cana.</p>
            <p> <span>Punta Cana</span> is one of the most sought destinations in the Caribbean. With visitors from all over the world, the island hosts well over six million guests annually, making it a booming tourism location.</p>
            <p>Punta Cana also has fantastic weather. In other words, you can enjoy the beach without hiding in the shade.</p>
            <p>With its savannah highlands and fabled rainforests, Punta Cana offered me the kind of adventure I wanted.</p>
            <p>This brings us to the story of how I came to choose Punta Cana as my holiday destination and what my stay looked like. So without further ado, let’s dive right into it.</p>
            <h3>Choosing the Destination</h3>
            <p>From the beginning, I want to state that my <span>Punta Cana vacation</span> wasn’t an overnight decision. </p>
            <p>I always knew something about the Dominican Republic was intriguing and wanted to see it in person. It was just a matter of timing. </p>
            <p>However, I did check out several resorts and locations before finally deciding to fly to Punta Cana.</p>
            <p>There were a lot of factors that went into the making of this decision. My priorities were food, entertainment, and comfort. After all, I was booking this trip to relax.</p>
            <p>The nightlife, beaches, rich culture, local restaurants, weather, and most importantly, the centrality of the airport all made me decide that Punta Cana was the way to go.</p>
            <p> Upon landing, I realized that I wasn’t mistaken. This destination cured the unquenchable thirst I didn’t know I had for an island vacation— and thanks to the airport location, I didn’t have trouble getting to the resort safely.</p>

            <div class="about_con1 cont_abo2">
            <img src="{{ asset('images/budget_1.jpg') }}" class="img-fluid" alt="" />
            <h3>Our Budget</h3>
           <p> I planned this trip for myself and my girlfriend, and our <span>Punta Cana trip budget</span> for two was $5k. While it might seem like a significant number initially, you should remember that we took a connecting flight that stopped at NY. </p>
           <p>If you’re coming from a different state, flying with another airline, or experimenting with other options, your budget might total at a lower or higher price.</p>
           <img class="bike_img" src="{{ asset('images/bike_race1.jpg') }}" class="img-fluid" alt="" />
           <h3>The Accommodation</h3>
           <p> <span>Punta Cana accommodations</span> can vary depending on your budget and personal preferences. </p>
           <p>Prices can also vary depending on the season, so my advice is, if you find something that checks several boxes for you, don’t hesitate to book it. </p>
           <p>Punta Cana is a highly desirable destination, so the chances are that you might lose your shot if you wait, which is why I just had to book Margaritaville for our trip. </p>
           <p>Jimmy Buffett owns Margaritaville, one of the newer resorts in Cap Cana. You can choose your booking from various rooms, but I went with a swim-up suite. </p>
           <p>Our second-floor view was almost as cozy as the room itself. We had a pool right outside, which came in very handy because the beach was closed due to a case of seaweed.</p>
           <h3>Activities In Punta Cana: Prices and Availabilities</h3>
           <p>Most <span>Punta Cana resorts</span> have restaurants and entertainment options, but when one goes to a place like Punta Cana, one must experience it to the fullest. So that’s what we decided to do.</p>
           <p>By default, the resort had arranged for specific options for entertainment; we would get picked up and be taken on an adventure that pushed us to exceed our comfort zones. </p>
           <p>But part of me didn’t want to stop at that. I craved to experience more. However, to “experience more,” I had to pay more— and we hadn’t been offered the option of booking a tour guide.  </p>
           <p>Luckily, fate took a turn, and we found a fantastic guide who gave us the whole experience. Thanks to him, we got to see Sabana De La Mar and many other hidden spots.</p>
           <p>Without him, this trip would have hardly been as memorable.</p>

            <h3>If This Had Been an iVacay Trip</h3>
           <p> IMeeting our guide gave me the idea for iVacay. Local guides know every nook and cranny of the destination, and our guide made me realize just how much appreciation these people deserved.  </p>
           <p>If this had been an iVacay trip, all the accommodation and travel information would’ve been readily available, automatically saving you from the research I had to do while looking into my trip.</p>
           <p>You would also have had a tour guide from the start and not waste any extra days or cash to get the whole experience of your destination.</p>
           <p>iVacay eliminates the mediators and gives you a direct link to local tour guides and entertainers, making your trip budget-friendly. In short, you experience more while paying less.</p>
           <h3>3 Things I Wish I’d Known Before Flying Out</h3>
           <p>My experience was vastly memorable, save for the unexpected expenses, but here are a few things I wish I’d known before flying out:</p>

        <div class="row">
         <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <div class="about_con1 cont_abo2">
            <ul>
                <li>Peak times are bad for travel; you can get the same experience for a more affordable price later.</li>
                <li>Always plan your excursions; if I had looked at mine more thoroughly, I could have squeezed in a lot more things than I did and paid a lot less for it.</li>
                <li>Always carry enough single-dollar bills to tip the locals. They’re ineffably friendly and deserve more appreciation than they get.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All in all, the experience is worth it when you have your travel plans sorted.</p>

                        <p>There’s often a stigma around <span>tourism</span>, most people will say that you should try
                            and see all
                            the
                            famous places, but that’s not always the goal. It can be so much more than just doing the
                            rounds
                            at some favorite tourist spots, especially if you’re one of those <span> backpackers</span>
                            who’s looking
                            for a
                            full-fledged adventure. Taking a trip should be a fulfilling activity, not a generic trail
                            of footsteps
                            that you’re expected to follow. At first, going from one place to another may seem like a
                            hassle
                            without those footsteps to track, but we can help you with that</p>
