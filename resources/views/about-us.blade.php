                        <p>There’s often a stigma around tourism, most people will say that you should try
                            and see all
                            the
                            famous places, but that’s not always the goal. It can be so much more than just doing the
                            rounds
                            at some favorite tourist spots, especially if you’re one of those backpackers
                            who’s looking
                            for a
                            full-fledged adventure. Taking a trip should be a fulfilling activity, not a generic trail
                            of footsteps
                            that you’re expected to follow. At first, going from one place to another may seem like a
                            hassle
                            without those footsteps to track, but we can help you with that</p>
                        <p>Founded in 2022, ivacay is a “one-of-a-kind” travel website that strives to become the
                            travel center of America in the long run.</p>

                            than
                            what to pack in your suitcases— and that should be your standard.
